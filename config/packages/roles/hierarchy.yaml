        # üè¢ SPECIALIZED EMPLOYEES
        # ===============================
        # These roles inherit from the base Employee role, granting them foundational employee access
        # plus their specific permissions (managed via access_control or voters).
        ROLE_SELLER:        [ROLE_EMPLOYEE]
        ROLE_LOGISTICIAN:   [ROLE_EMPLOYEE]
        ROLE_DATA_AGENT:    [ROLE_EMPLOYEE]
        ROLE_AFTERSALES:    [ROLE_EMPLOYEE]

        # ===============================
        # üë§ CUSTOMERS
        # ===============================
        # Specific customer types inheriting from the base Customer role.
        ROLE_CUSTOMER_CE:   [ROLE_CUSTOMER]     # Individual customer (e.g., for specific pricing)
        ROLE_CUSTOMER_PRO:  [ROLE_CUSTOMER]     # Professional customer (e.g., B2B specific features/pricing)

        # Note: Base roles like ROLE_EMPLOYEE and ROLE_CUSTOMER typically don't need to be listed
        # on the left if they don't inherit from other roles. They serve as building blocks.
